There is no requirement that this property      represents a formal primary, alternate, or foreign key; it is simply      used to determine how rows should match up for the import. This property      is only relevant when the target table already exists. If, based      on this key, there are duplicate source rows, only the first row      is used, and the duplicate source rows are discarded on the import.      If, based in this key, there are duplicate target rows, then all      of the target rows that correspond to a source row will be updated      by that source row.</p>      <p>If the LookupKey property is empty, the default value, then no      rows are considerd to match, and all source rows are considered "new",      and will be inserted into the target table.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
