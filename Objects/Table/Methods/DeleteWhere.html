For example:</p>      <pre>        <code>      D=Scripting.Server.OpenDatabase 'SandP'      T=D.GetTable 'SP'      T.DeleteWhere "QTY gt 200"┌────┐│6   │└Int8┘</code>      </pre>      <p>No rows will be deleted if there are any outstanding references      to any single specified row. In this case an error is signalled.</p>      <p>See also the →[Delete] method, for deleting rows by primary key      value.</p>      <p>Note that in FlipDB, deletes are logical - no data is destroyed      or overwritten. This allows for historical queries, but it also means      that deleting rows does not free up disk space. In fact, in FlipDB      deleting rows is as expensive as updating rows, and takes up additional      space. In certain circumstances, it is useful to physically delete      rows, which may be accomplished with the →[Purge] and →[PurgeWhere]      methods.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
