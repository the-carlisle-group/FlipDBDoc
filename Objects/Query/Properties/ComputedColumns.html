The Where, WhereNot, and GroupBy clauses are      applied to ComputedColumn just as regular columns; they must conform      in length to the table. Scalar values are acceptable.</p>      <p>This property is often used to specify row, group and order dependent      hybrid expressions that would not evaluate property under the GroupBy      clause. In addition, it is a useful place to specify global variables      for the query.</p>      <p>        See also the →[        <em>.Report.Properties.Globals] property of the →[</em>        .Report] object.      </p>    </main>  </body></html>
