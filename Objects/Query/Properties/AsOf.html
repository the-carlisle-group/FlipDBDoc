Normally it is set to 0, which indicates the current      or latest state of the database. If a DateTime is specified the query      is applied to the database as it appeared at that time. If a negative      integer N is specified, the database is rolled back M transactions,      where M is the absolute value of N (for purposes of the query only).</p>      <p>The AsOf property may also be set to 1. In this case the query      operates on the complete history of a table, and including deleted      and inactive rows. Duplicate keys values may result.</p>      <p>The AsOf property may also be set to 2. This value indicates that      the AsOf property should inherit its value from the Report.DataSource      property should the query be embedded in a report. This is the default      value when a new query is added to a report using the GUI. This value      has no effect in a stand-alone query, and will behave as the value      0.</p>      <p>This property may be overridden when running a query by providing      a suitable argument to the →[##.MethodList.Execute] method. This      argument may be any of the values specified above except 2. It may      also be void, to indicate the actual value of the AsOf property is      to be used and not overridden.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
