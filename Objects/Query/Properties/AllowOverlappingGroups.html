Overlapping groups may only occur when      grouping by a boolean expression set, so this property has no effect      when grouping by the unique values of columns.</p>      <p>If AllowOverlappingGroups is set to 0 (the default), then FlipDB      enforces mutually exclusive groups by removing rows for consideration      that fall into any preceding group. Thus the ordering of a boolean      expression set is important.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
