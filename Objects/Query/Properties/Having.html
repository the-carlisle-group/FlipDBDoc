This is in contrast to the Where property, which is      applied at the beginning of the execution of a query.</p>      <p>The Having property is formally a DataTable with an Expression      column (a Boolean expression set), and may be specified as such,      but it may also conveniently be specified as a simple string. The      helper method →[##.MethodList.AddHaving] may be used to incrementally      add a having expression. Like the Where property, multiple having      expression are "and-ed" together. All names referred to in having      expression must exist in the result of the query. In other words,      while a where expression may refer to any column in the starting      table, a having expression may only refer to Select property names.</p>      <p>If no grouping is applied, and if there are no hybrid or summary      functions in the column expressions, then the Having property has      the same effect as an additional clause in the →[Where] property.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
