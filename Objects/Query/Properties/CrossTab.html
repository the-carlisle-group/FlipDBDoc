Otherwise it is 1, which      indicates that the first grouping specifies the vertical axis and      the second grouping specifies the horizontal axis.</p>      <p>The CrossTab property only has effect when exactly two groups      are specified.</p>      <p>        The Select property of a crosstab query must be made up of one        or more aggregate expressions. The most common applicable aggregate        functions are →[        <em>.count], →[</em>        .sum], →[        <em>.percentDown], →[</em>        .percentAcross] and →[*.percentOverall].      </p>      <p>Hybrid functions applied on top of an aggregate expression will      work, but the results are probably not useful as they are always      applied to the overall crosstab, and not down the columns or across      the rows. For example, a running sum will be computed over the entire      crosstab, in row major order.</p>      <p>The column names for all but the vertical axis in the query result      are generated by the system. Column names are drawn from the values      in the column defining the horizontal axis if the horizontal axis      is defined by a character column, and the unique values in the column      are valid FlipDB column names, and only one aggregate measure is      defined (one item in the Select property). In all other cases, column      names for all but the vertical axis are specified as C001, C002,      etc.</p>      <p>However, fully descriptive names are generated and specified as      the DisplayName for each column. The DisplayName is used when viewing      the result in the GUI, and when the result is embedded in a report.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
