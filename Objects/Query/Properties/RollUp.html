The      RollUp property only effects grouped queries.</p>      <p>The effect of the Having and HavingQuota properties is to discard      groups from the result set of a query. If RollUp is 0, the default,      these groups are simply discarded. If RollUp is 1, then these groups      are combined into one new group, which is appended to the end of      the result set.</p>      <p>Note that RollUp property will NOT select rows excluded by a non-exhaustive      statement set. To accomplish this use the key word [StatementSetComplement]      as a statement.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
