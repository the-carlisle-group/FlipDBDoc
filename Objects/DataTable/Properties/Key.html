The Key        property is an implicit argument referenced by any DataTable method        that requires a row lookup between two DataTables, inlcuding 竊端        <em>.DataTable.MethodList.AddRows], 竊端</em>        .DataTable.MethodList.UpdateRows], and 竊端*.DataTable.MethodList.AddColumns].      </p>      <p>The Key property of a DataTable is distinct from the primary key,      alternate key, and foreign key concepts of a Table object, though      it may represent them.</p>      <p>        A DataTable does        <strong>not</strong>        enforce uniqueness on a column named as the key column, as the        column may or may not represent a primary key, and uniqueness may        not be appropriate.      </p>      <p>When setting the Key property, the columns specified must exist.      However, when referencing the Key property, the columns specified      may or may not exist. Thus methods that implicitly use the Key property,      like AddRows, may signal a "Key column not found" error.</p>      <p>If either one or both tables has no key specified, then no rows      are considered to match. Otherwise, the key columns specified for      each table must correspond in number and type, or an error will be      signalled. The actual names of the key columns do not need to match,      so they must be specified in the proper order. For example the Key      'SNO,PNO' is NOT the same as 'PNO,SNO'.</p>      <p>The default value of the Key property of a new instance of a DataTable      is empty. However, if the DataTable is the result of a database query,      and the query result includes the primary key column of the starting      table, then the Key property defaults to the name of the primary      key column.</p>      <p>A side effect of setting the Key property is to clear all pending      changes in the DataTable, resetting the Changed property to 0</p>    </main>  </body></html>
