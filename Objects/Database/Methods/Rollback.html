If the argument      is a negative integer N (or zero), the database is rolled back N      transactions. If the argument is a positive integer P, then the database      is rolled back to transaction id (TWID) P. If the argument is a date      or datetime D, then the database is rolled back to the last transaction      on or before D.</p>      <p>Note that only updates, inserts and deletes to tables are rolled      back. Changes to the schema, like changing a column type, deleting      a table, or specifying a foreign key, are not rolled back. In addition,      changes to computed column definitions, reports, etc., are not rolled      back.</p>      <p>Note further that in a multi-user scenario, the transaction ids      (TWIDs) are not necessarily written to the transaction table in numerical      order, as they would be in a stand-alone situation. This is because      TWIDs are assigned at the beginning of a transaction, but are not      written to the transaction table itself until the end of the transaction.      Therefore, when rolling back to a specific transaction id, it is      possible that one or more transactions with numerically lower TWIDs      will be removed as well. For example rolling back to transaction      number 15 may remove transaction 14 if 14 completed execution after      15, even though 14 started executing before 15.</p>      <p>Finally, if rolling back changes due to importing to an existing      table, note that the import process uses one transaction for updating      existing rows, and another transaction for adding new rows. Thus,      depending on the situation, rolling back the results of an import      may require an argument of -1 or -2.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
