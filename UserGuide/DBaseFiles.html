They usually have a "dbf" extension.      They contain data on a single table (unlike, say, a Microsoft Access      .mdb file which contains a set of tables.)</p>      <p>A dBase file may have character, date, and numeric fields. FlipDB      will automatically convert these to the corresponding FlipDB data      types. dBase files may contain deleted records. These records are      not imported.</p>      <p>dBase files are well-structured and they are extremely fast to      import. If receiving data from a dBase system, always request native      dBase files rather than CSV or Excel files.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
