(There are also fixed width EBCDIC      files. These are discussed in detail in the section on COBOL files.)      Importing a fixed width file requires the name, starting byte and      the width in bytes of each field you wish to import. All fields are      initially imported as Char columns and must be converted to the appropriate      FlipDB data type by applying a casting function like toInteger or      toDate. In some cases, a fixed width file will not have embedded      new line characters, and the record length in bytes will have to      be explicitly specified using the RecordLength property.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
