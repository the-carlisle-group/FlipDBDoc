If an installation is launched in Server      mode, FlipDB is listening for HTTP requests on the standard HTTP      port 80. You can point your web browser to the appropriate IP address      or domain name, and begin browsing the FlipDB server. This built-in      web application allows you to navigate through all of the content      of a FlipDB server, execute queries, and create, edit, and delete      objects.</p>      <p>FlipDB can respond to HTTP requests with various content types      depending on the preferences of the client. For web browsers, this      is usually an HTML document. FlipDB can also respond with JSON. If      you are writing a JavaScript based web application that needs to      communicate with a FlipDB server, you might ask for and receive JSON.      The details of communicating with a FlipDB server via HTTP are detailed      in the section HTTP API.</p>      <p>A web resource is anything that can be identified, retrieved or      manipulated on the Web. FlipDB objects map to web resources in an      obvious and intuitive way. A database, a table, and a column are      all resources. A query object is a resource, and the folder in which      the query object is saved is a resource. In addition, the result      of a query object (a DataTable) is also a resource. Every resource      has an address or URL (uniform resource locater). For example, a      list of the databases on the server may be found at:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Databases</code>      </pre>      <p>And the suppliers and parts database, if it exists, may be found      at:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Databases/Parts</code>      </pre>      <p>While the part table may be found at:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Databases/Parts/P</code>      </pre>      <p>Each representation of a resource provides information about and      links to the resources below it in the hierarchy. Thus the /Databases      page provides links to all the databases, the /Database/SandP page      provides links to all the tables in the database, and the the /Databases/SandP/P      page provides links to all the columns in the parts table. In addition      to /Databases, other top level entry points include:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Objects</code>      </pre>      <p>which provides access to folders, reports, scripts and other objects,      and:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Files</code>      </pre>      <p>Which provides general file storage and retrieval, and:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Documentation</code>      </pre>      <p>which provides access to documentation on the object model and      functions, and:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Users</code>      </pre>      <p>which provides access to users, user groups and permissions, and:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Log</code>      </pre>      <p>which provides access to log files.</p>      <p>These, then, are resources. HTTP operates on resources via a limited      set of methods or verbs. These include GET, PUT, DELETE and POST.      The GET method is used to retrieve resources, the PUT method to create      or replace resources, the DELETE method to delete resources, and      the POST method for modifying resources and anything else that does      not fit neatly into GET, PUT, or DELETE. Not all methods apply to      all resources. For example, you may not DELETE, PUT or POST to documentation      resources. Of course, all access is dependent on the user's level      of authorization.</p>      <p>While the FlipDB API supports all of these methods, Web browsers      generally only support two HTTP methods: GET and POST. It is not      possible to execute DELETE and PUT directly from the browser. While      other user agents can do DELETEs and PUTs, web browsers have limited      functionality by design. In order to get around this limitation and      to provide full functionality from a Web browser, FlipDB allows methods      from its object model to be accessed as resources. For example, to      create a new table in the SandP database we can enter this URL in      the browser address bar:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Databases/SandP.CreateTable</code>      </pre>      <p>Similarly, to delete a column from the parts table of the SandP      database:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Databases/SandP/P.DeleteColumn</code>      </pre>      <p>The HTML representation, (the page returned to and displayed by      the browser) of the method resource is a form, with fields for entering      the method's argument, and an Execute button for posting the form      back to the server. This executes the method on the appropriate object      with the argument specified in the form.</p>      <p>In addition to creating and deleting resources, other FlipDB methods      may be used to modify resources. For example, the data type of a      column may be changed:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Databases/SandP/WEIGHT.ChangeType</code>      </pre>      <p>Server methods like CreateDatabase and CreateUser are accessed      under /Databases and /Users respectively, even though they are members      of the Server object. For example:</p>      <pre>        <code>     /Databases.CreateDatabase</code>      </pre>      <p>and:</p>      <pre>        <code>     /Users.CreateUser</code>      </pre>      <p>Links to all of these method resources are provided in the corresponding      representation of the associated object for easy discovery.</p>      <p>Table resources may be queried to return the value for the table      rather than the schema of the table.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
