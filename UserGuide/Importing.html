The Import      object has properties that define the data source, the transformation      that should be applied to the data source, the target table, and,      if the target table exists, how it should be updated. Once these      properties have been set, the Execute method is called to run the      import and create or update the destination table.</p>      <p>The Import Wizard allows for a visual, incremental approach to      using the Import object where you are asked to specify only the necessary      properties for a particular data source, one (or a few) at a time,      in a logical order, with feedback at each step. This feedback helps      you make the appropriate choice for the various properties. For example,      you are asked to specify whether new rows should be added an existing      table only after specifying the lookup column and, given that lookup      column, being informed of how many rows match, how many are unique,      and how many rows are new. Once you have stepped through the wizard,      the associated Import object is saved and may be re-executed with      the wizard or loaded and executed in a script.</p>      <p>        The general approach of the Import Object and Wizard may be divided        into three major steps. (The actual wizard is divided into more        steps, which are detailed in the following section) First, bring        in the data source as-is, with the fewest possible questions asked,        into a temporary table. Many properties of the Import object are        data source specific and are only relevant at this stage. For example,        in the case of a CSV file data source, this requires specifying        the FileName, 竊端        <em>.Delimiter], 竊端</em>        .TextQualifier] and 竊端*.HasHeader] properties. Once this stage        is complete, the type of data source is immaterial.      </p>      <p>Second, transform this temporary table as necessary by renaming      columns, recasting data types, mapping column values and creating      new columns. This is accomplished with the 竊端*.Transformation] property,      which is an expression set used as the Select property of a Query      that is then applied to the temporary table to produce the transformed      table.</p>      <p>Finally, specify the target table, lookup keys, and how the target      should be updated, including whether or not new rows and columns      should be added and existing rows updated.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
