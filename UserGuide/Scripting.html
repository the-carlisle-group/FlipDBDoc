When editing a script, it may be executed      from the main menu of the editor, by selecting the Run button. In      addition, a script may be traced line-by-line, inspecting the results      along the way, using the Trace button.</p>      <p>        Scripts may call scripts using the →[        <em>.executeScript] function. This function may also be used to        execute scripts in queries or in the →[</em>        .Globals] property of a report, or interactively in the session.      </p>      <p>A script may take an argument and return a result. In general,      if a script takes an argument or returns a result, it is designed      to be called by another script or run interactively in the session.      The explicit result of a script that is run from the main menu is      discarded.</p>      <p>        A script may access its argument using the reserved word        <code>Argument</code>        . The argument may be any FlipDB object from a →[        <em>.DataColumn], to a →[</em>        .DataTable], to a →[*.PropertySpace]. If no argument is provided        to the script, the key word        <code>Argument</code>        returns a zero within the script.      </p>      <p>        The result of a script is specified using the key word        <code>Result</code>        , which may be set to any FlipDB object. If not specified, the        result of the script defaults to zero.      </p>      <p>        A scripts access the server via the reserved word        <code>TheServer</code>        .      </p>    </main>  </body></html>
