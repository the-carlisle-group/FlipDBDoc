<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="utf-8"></meta>    <base href="/FlipDBDoc"/>    <link href="/UserGuide.css" rel="stylesheet"></link>  </head>  <body>    <main>      <h1>The Session</h1>      <p>The FlipDB session is a window for entering and evaluating FlipDB      expressions. Depending on the setup, the session window may be the      primary window and the first thing you see on starting FlipDB. If      you are in the Explorer, you may launch the session by going to the      Tools/Session menu.</p>      <p>The session allows you to type an expression and press the &lt;Enter&gt;      key to evaluate it. Once the expression is evaluated, the result      is displayed. For example, the integer 5 is a valid FlipDB expression:</p>      <pre>        <code>      5┌────┐│5   │└Int8┘</code>      </pre>      <p>After pressing &lt;Enter&gt; the session responds with the result      of the expression and positions the cursor on the next line, indented      6 spaces, ready for you to enter another expression. Expressions      can include functions:</p>      <pre>        <code>      sum 1 2 3 4 5┌────┐│15  │└Int8┘</code>      </pre>      <p>The result of an expression may be assigned to a name for further      use. The assignment operator is the equal symbol:</p>      <pre>        <code>      A=1 2 3</code>      </pre>      <p>Assignment suppresses the display of the result in the session.      However, the assigned name is now a variable that may be referenced      in any expression, and it may be displayed by simply entering it:</p>      <pre>        <code>      A┌────┐↓1   ││2   ││3   │└Int8┘</code>      </pre>      <p>The session provides access to the FlipDB database server via      the →[##.##.Reference.Objects.Scripting] object. Simply type "Scripting"      into the session to access the scripting object. The →[##.##.Reference.Objects.Scripting.Properties.Server]      property of the scripting object returns the one and only instance      of the Server object available in a given session. With an instance      of the server in hand, its properties and methods may be exercised.</p>      <p>The Server has a method for creating the long -standing and well-known      suppliers and parts database of E.F. Codd and C.J Date, who use it      in their many writings. However, before creating it, it must be deleted      if it already exists. This is done with the →[##.##.Reference.Objects.Server.MethodList.DeleteDatabase]      method:</p>      <pre>        <code>      Scripting.Server.DeleteDatabase 'SandP'┌───────┐│0      │└Boolean┘</code>      </pre>      <p>Now that it is sure not to exist, it may be created:</p>      <pre>        <code>      D=Scripting.Server.BuildSuppliersAndParts ''</code>      </pre>      <p>The result is a →[##.##.Reference.Objects.Database] object, which      in turn exposes properties and methods. For example, the →[##.##.Reference.Objects.Database.MethodList.GetTable]      method returns a table object:</p>      <pre>        <code>      D.GetTable 'S'── SandP.S ────────────────────────────────────── ┌SNO────┐  ┌SNAME─────┐  ┌STATUS┐  ┌CITY──────┐ ↓S1     │  ↓Smith     │  ↓20    │  ↓London    │ │S2     │  │Jones     │  │10    │  │Paris     │ │S3     │  │Blake     │  │30    │  │Paris     │ │S4     │  │Clark     │  │20    │  │London    │ │S5     │  │Adams     │  │30    │  │Athens    │ └Char(2)┘  └Char(10)──┘  └Int8──┘  └Char(10)──┘── 5 rows by 4 columns ──────────────────────────</code>      </pre>      <h2>Playing Help Topics and Scripts</h2>      <p>Help topics (including this one) and scripts may be "played" in      the session by selecting the File/Play menu from the Help window      and the script editor window respectively. When a help topic is played,      the executable code from the topic is loaded into the session, and      may be played back interactively, line-by-line, by pressing the &lt;F8&gt;      key. This allows you to easily follow the help topic in the session,      without typing all the input lines, where you can inspect and explore      the objects and variables. Similarly, when a script is played, it      is loaded into the session for line-by-line playback. Note that a      line of a script or help topics that contain a control structure      will not play back in the session as it is not a complete statement.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
