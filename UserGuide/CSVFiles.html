(Thus the abbreviation CSV for Comma Separated Values.)      CSV files may or may not have field names on the first row. The HasHeader      property indicates whether or not the first row contains field names.      CSV files may have any character as the delimiter, not just a comma.      Popular delimiters are tabs, spaces, and pipes (shift M on your keyboard).      The delimiter is specified using the Delimiter property.</p>      <p>To handle the case where the delimiter character is embedded inside      a field CSV files have a "text qualifier" character that surrounds      the value of the field. This is usually the double quote character.      The text qualifier is specified using the TextQualifier property.</p>      <p>All fields are initially imported as Char columns and must be      converted to the appropriate FlipDB data type by applying a casting      function like toInteger or toDate.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
