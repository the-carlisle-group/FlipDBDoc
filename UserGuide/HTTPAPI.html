It is      not possible to execute DELETE and PUT directly from the browser.      While other user agents can do DELETEs and PUTs, web browsers have      limited functionality by design. In order to get around this limitation,      FlipDB allows methods from its object model to be accessed as resources.      For example, to create a new table in the SandP database we can enter      this URL in the browser address bar:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Databases/SandP.CreateTable</code>      </pre>      <p>Similarly, to delete a column from the parts table of the SandP      database:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Databases/SandP/P.DeleteColumn</code>      </pre>      <p>The HTML representation, (the page returned to and displayed by      the browser) of the method resource is a form, with fields for entering      the method's argument, and an Execute button for posting the form      back to the server. This executes the method on the server on the      appropriate object with the specified argument.</p>      <p>In addition to creating and deleting resources, other FlipDB methods      may be used to modify resources. For example, the data type of a      column may be changed:</p>      <pre>        <code>      /Databases/SandP/WEIGHT.ChangeType</code>      </pre>      <p>Server methods like CreateDatabase and CreateUser are accessed      at the corresponding node. For example:</p>      <pre>        <code>     /Databases.CreateDatabase</code>      </pre>      <p>and:</p>      <pre>        <code>     /Users.CreateUser</code>      </pre>      <p>We should probably make Databases and Users actual singleton classes,      so that we can have HTML reps, and put the server methods in there,      (Users.Add rather than Server.AddUsers) This would make the resource      hierarchy consistent across the object model and the web. Note that      we already have (almost) a Folder class that is returned from '/Objects'</p>    </main>  </body></html>
