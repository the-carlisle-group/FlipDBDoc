This tells the server      to return the value of the table rather than the schema of the table:</p>      <pre>        <code>GET /Databases/SandP/P? HTTP/1.1Accept: application/jsonConnection: closeHost: localhost</code>      </pre>      <pre>        <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OKContent-Type: application/jsonDate: Fri, 12 Jun 2015 13:11:16 GMTServer: RumbaConnection: closeContent-Length: 1368 {    Class: "DataTable",    Columns: [             {                 Class: "Char",                 Name: "PNO",                 Type: "Char(2)",                 Scale: 0,                 Structure: 1,                 Value: ["P1", "P2", "P3", "P4", "P5", "P6"]             },             {                 Class: "Char",                 Name: "PNAME",                 Type: "Char(5)",                 Scale: 0,                 Structure: 1,                 Value: ["Nut", "Bolt", "Screw", "Screw", "Cam", "Cog"]             },...Truncated</code>      </pre>      <p>For simple queries we can add name and value pairs to the query      string that correspond to properties of the FlipDB Query object.      For example, we might select only the part number and color columns,      as well as only the first 3 rows:</p>      <pre>        <code>GET /Databases/SandP/P?Select=PNO,COLOR&amp;WhereQuota=3 HTTP/1.1Accept: application/jsonConnection: closeHost: localhost</code>      </pre>      <pre>        <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OKContent-Type: application/jsonDate: Fri, 12 Jun 2015 13:19:40 GMTServer: RumbaConnection: closeContent-Length: 540{    Class: "DataTable",    Columns: [             {                 Class: "Char",                 Name: "PNO",                 Type: "Char(2)",                 Scale: 0,                 Structure: 1,                 Value: ["P1", "P2", "P3"]             },             {                 Class: "Char",                 Name: "COLOR",                 Type: "Char(5)",                 Scale: 0,                 Structure: 1,                 Value: ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]             }             ]}</code>      </pre>      <p>This technique is fine for simple queries. It also has the advantage      of being cacheable. But trying to place all of the properties of      a complex query in the query string of the URL can be difficult at      best. The solution is to construct a query object and send it in      the payload of a POST to the /Execute URI:</p>      <pre>        <code>POST /Execute HTTP/1.1Accept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonConnection: closeHost: localhostContent-Length: 80{Class: "Query",DatabaseName: "SandP",GroupBy: "COLOR",TableName: "P"}</code>      </pre>      <pre>        <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OKContent-Type: application/jsonDate: Fri, 12 Jun 2015 21:48:33 GMTServer: RumbaConnection: closeContent-Length: 543{    Class: "DataTable",    Columns: [             {                 Class: "Char",                 Name: "GroupByCOLOR",                 Type: "Char(5)",                 Scale: 0,                 Structure: 1,                 Value: ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]             },             {                 Class: "Integer",                 Name: "RowCount",                 Type: "Int8",                 Scale: 0,                 Structure: 1,                 Value: [3, 1, 2]             }             ]}</code>      </pre>      <p>While simplifying the URI, POSTing has the disadvantage of not      being cacheable. We can overcome this limitation by using a two-step      process: first PUTting the query object to the server as a resource      in its own right, and then GETting this resource. Let's take the      above query object and PUT it to the server:</p>      <pre>        <code>PUT /Objects/MyQuery HTTP/1.1Accept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonConnection: closeHost: localhostContent-Length: 80{Class: "Query",DatabaseName: "SandP",GroupBy: "COLOR",TableName: "P"}</code>      </pre>      <pre>        <code>HTTP/1.1 201 CreatedDate: Fri, 12 Jun 2015 21:59:50 GMTServer: RumbaConnection: closeContent-Length: 0Content-Type: text/html</code>      </pre>      <p>Now we can execute the query by doing a GET on this new URI with      a ? tacked on the end to force an evaluation:</p>      <pre>        <code>GET /Objects/MyQuery? HTTP/1.1Accept: application/jsonConnection: closeHost: localhost</code>      </pre>      <pre>        <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OKContent-Type: application/jsonDate: Fri, 12 Jun 2015 22:26:02 GMTServer: RumbaConnection: closeContent-Length: 543{    Class: "DataTable",    Columns: [             {                 Class: "Char",                 Name: "GroupByCOLOR",                 Type: "Char(5)",                 Scale: 0,                 Structure: 1,                 Value: ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]             },             {                 Class: "Integer",                 Name: "RowCount",                 Type: "Int8",                 Scale: 0,                 Structure: 1,                 Value: [3, 1, 2]             }             ]}</code>      </pre>      <p>We can also execute this query with slightly different parameters      by passing them in the query string of the URI:</p>      <pre>        <code>GET /Objects/MyQuery?GroupBy=CITY HTTP/1.1Accept: application/jsonConnection: closeHost: localhost</code>      </pre>      <pre>        <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OKContent-Type: application/jsonDate: Fri, 12 Jun 2015 22:31:09 GMTServer: RumbaConnection: closeContent-Length: 546{    Class: "DataTable",    Columns: [             {                 Class: "Char",                 Name: "GroupByCITY",                 Type: "Char(10)",                 Scale: 0,                 Structure: 1,                 Value: ["London", "Paris", "Oslo"]             },             {                 Class: "Integer",                 Name: "RowCount",                 Type: "Int8",                 Scale: 0,                 Structure: 1,                 Value: [3, 2, 1]             }             ]}</code>      </pre>      <p>Note that this does not change the definition of the saved query,      which can only be done with a PUT. And finally, of course, we can      retrieve the definition of the query itself:</p>      <pre>        <code>GET /Objects/MyQuery HTTP/1.1Accept: application/jsonConnection: closeHost: localhost</code>      </pre>      <pre>        <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OKContent-Type: application/jsonDate: Fri, 12 Jun 2015 22:42:39 GMTServer: RumbaConnection: closeContent-Length: 9770{    Class: "Query",    AllowOverlappingGroups:{                               Class: "Boolean",                               Type: "Boolean",                               Scale: 0,                               Structure: 0,                               Value: 0                           },    AsOf:{             Class: "Integer",             Type: "Int8",             Scale: 0,             Structure: 0,             Value: 2         },...Truncated</code>      </pre>    </main>  </body></html>
