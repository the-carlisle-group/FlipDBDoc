The wizard is divided into 6      pages or steps.</p>      <h3>Step 1: Specify the Data Source Type</h3>      <p>The first wizard page specifies the SourceType property of the      associated Import object. This may be "CSV", "Excel", "dBase", "ADO",      "ODBC", "FixedWidth" and "FlipDB". This is the only piece of information      required on this page.</p>      <h3>Step 2: Specify SourceType Specific Properties.</h3>      <p>Once the SourceType has been specified, the Wizard knows what      other SourceType-specific properties of the Import object are required.      These are all requested on the second page. For example, if the SourceType      is dBase, the only item required is the SourceName, which is the      dBase file name. However, if the SourceType is FixedWidth, then the      required items include SourceName, FixedWidthLayout and RecordLength.      This page is the only wizard page that depends on the SourceType;      All other wizard pages are identical regardless of the SourceType.      At this point, FlipDB has enough information to minimally process      the data source and create a temporary FlipDB table, which it does      when you press "Next" to advance to the next page. This temporary      table is called the "raw source table". In the case of a CSV file,      all columns of this temporary table will be Char, as a CVS file has      no additional type information. Other data sources may have type      information, and the temporary table will respect these types to      the extent possible.</p>      <h3>Step 3: Specify the Target and Reference Tables</h3>      <p>While FlipDB is now ready to apply a transformation to the raw      source table, it is helpful to first know the target table. If the      target table exists, then FlipDB knows the required columns and data      types and can assist the user in transforming the raw source to match      up with the target. If the specified target table does not exist,      then a "reference table" may be specified which performs the same      function. The reference table is used only as guide and is not updated      or altered in any way.</p>      <h3>Step 4: Associate source columns or expressions with target columns.</h3>      <p>Once the raw source table is available, and the target table is      specified, a transformation must be applied to the source so that      it corresponds with the target. This involves mapping source column      names to target column names, modifying the type or values of source      columns, writing expressions to create new columns, and discarding      unneeded source columns. This transformation is accomplished by a      simple, standard FlipDB query on the raw source table. Page 4 of      the wizard displays Transformation property of the associated Import      object, which is used as the Select property of this query. The query      is executed when the user advances to the next page. The result of      the query is another temporary table known as the "transformed source      table".</p>      <h3>Step 5: Specify Keys</h3>      <p>If the target file does not exist, then this page asks you to      specify the primary key column. If a reference table is specified,      the reference table's primary key column name will be suggested,      but any column with unique values may be specified, including the      built-in auto-incrementing column AUTOKEY. If the target file does      exist, then this page asks you to specify a "lookup key". The lookup      key may consist of zero or more column names. All of these columns      must exist in the transformed source table and the target table.      The most common case is for the lookup key to be the primary key      of the target table, but it is often useful to look up rows based      on an alternate key, or even other non-unique column or column combinations.      If the lookup key contains no column names, then all rows in the      transformed source will be considered "new" (In general, and empty      lookup key is used only when the target table is auto-keyed.) When      the lookup key is specified and the Next button is pressed, FlipDB      performs an analysis of key values in the transformed source and      in the target table, the results of which are presented on the next      wizard page.</p>      <h3>Step 6: Review Statistics, and Specify Actions</h3>      <p>This page displays all of the relevant statistics about the raw      source table and the transformed source table, and how they compare      to the target table. With this information in hand is you are asked      to specify how the target should be updated. If the target does not      exist the only relevant action is to create and load it. If the target      does exist, then there are three options: Add new rows, update existing      rows and add new columns. This is the final page before FlipDB actually      modifies the target table or creates the target table if it does      not exist. It is the last page at which you may cancel the wizard      or go backwards in the wizard.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
