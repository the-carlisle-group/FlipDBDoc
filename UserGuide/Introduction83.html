<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="utf-8"></meta>    <link href="/UserGuide.css" rel="stylesheet"></link>  </head>  <body>    <main>      <h1>Introduction</h1>      <p>FlipDB is a relational database management system (RDBMS), programming      language, and object model.</p>      <p>FlipDB Desktop is designed from the ground up with a focus on      solving the complex data problems of the mortgage and asset finance      business, but it is a general purpose application suitable for a      wide range of industries and problems.</p>      <p>FlipDB Desktop provides immediate, out-of-the-box functionality      for ad hoc data analysis, manipulation and reporting, while simultaneously      providing a foundation for building enterprise-wide, multi-user,      industrial-strength solutions.</p>      <p>Mortgages push the limits of many systems due to the quantity      of data items, variety of products, constant innovation, and a never-ending      stream of file formats and standards. Mortgage industry reporting      requires repeated full-table scans, taxing the limits of traditional      database management systems. Whole-loan mortgage trading and securitization      requires massive amounts of data analysis, manipulation and reporting,      often over an extended period of time. Data conversion is a major      problem in the mortgage industry, and ETL (extract, translate, and      load) processes are the daily routine of mortgage trading, rather      than periodic one-off tasks for an IT department. Many facets of      the mortgage industry require just the right balance of transaction-oriented      and analytic database features as well spreadsheet functionality,      not often found in a single product. Conventional solutions to this      problem require multiple products, a large technology stack, and      a wide range of technical skills and staff. The results are often      difficult achieve, costly to build and maintain, and error prone.      FlipDB provides a single, coherent and unified environment ideally      suited for building solutions to a wide range of mortgage related      problems.</p>      <h2>The FlipDB GUI</h2>      <p>FlipDB has a rich, native Windows GUI, which is a requirement      for complex, data intensive applications. A browser-based application      simply cannot provide a satisfactory user experience for the type      of work that FlipDB is designed to do. The major components of the      GUI include:</p>      <table>        <thead>          <tr>            <th class="center">-</th>            <th class="center">-</th>          </tr>        </thead>        <tbody>          <tr>            <td class="center">Table Explorer</td>            <td class="center">For viewing, querying, analyzing and manipulating            a single table.</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="center">Query Results Viewer</td>            <td class="center">For displaying the results of a query, with            drill-down capabilities.</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="center">Import Wizard</td>            <td class="center">An extensive wizard with step-by-step instructions            and feedback for importing data into FlipDB.</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="center">Report Writer</td>            <td class="center">For creating, running and viewing reports.</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="center">Expression Builder</td>            <td class="center">For entering and testing a single column-returning            expression, with context sensitive help and auto-complete for            functions and column names.</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="center">Table Editor</td>            <td class="center">For editing the contents of a table or the            result of a query.</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="center">Script Editor</td>            <td class="center">For creating, editing and running FlipDB            scripts.</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="center">Session</td>            <td class="center">For entering FlipDB expressions for immediate            execution and feedback, and for debugging scripts.</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="center">Tracer</td>            <td class="center">For stepping line-by-line through queries,            reports, and scripts.</td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>      <h2>The RDBMS</h2>      <p>At the heart of FlipDB is a column-oriented, multi-user, relational      database management system. The DBMS is specifically designed to      support a mix of on-line transaction processing (OLTP) and on-line      analytic processing (OLAP) in a unified environment with no duplication      of data.</p>      <p>FlipDB uses extreme multi-value concurrency control (XMVCC), where      no data is ever overwritten. In addition to being the foundation      for an extremely reliable and robust data store for concurrent use,      XMVCC makes FlipDB a temporal DBMS in that a query may not only be      applied to the current state of a database, but to any past state      as well. The practical uses of this feature cannot be overstated.      Finally, XMVCC ensures complete and secure audit trails, with full      history of every change to every data item. FlipDB supports atomicity,      consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID).</p>      <h2>The Object Model and Programming Language</h2>      <p>All of the functionality of FlipDB, including the RDBMS, ancillary      data structures, and the report writing tools, is exposed through      a single, unified object model. The object model is simple yet provides      a rich set of functionality to solve a wide range of problems.</p>      <p>FlipDB has a full-featured programming language specifically designed      to work with column-oriented databases, and fully integrated with      the FlipDB object model. This means that the FlipDB database query      language and programming language are one and the same.</p>      <h2>Installation and Usage Scenarios.</h2>      <p>There are three ways to install and use FlipDB. In a single-user      scenario, FlipDB is installed in standalone mode on a single machine      for a single user. In this scenario, the data folder (where databases,      objects, etc., are stored) is usually on the same machine.</p>      <p>In a server-less workgroup scenario, FlipDB is installed in standalone      mode for each user on their machine as in a single-user scenario,      but the data folder for each user is on a common network drive, accessible      to all users. This allows users to work with each other's data, and      is analogous to having multiple users of Microsoft Excel sharing      workbooks on network drive.</p>      <p>In a web server scenario, FlipDB is installed on a server machine      in server mode, where it listens and responds to HTTP requests. Users      can access FlipDB's built-in web application by simply pointing their      web browser to the appropriate address. In addition, other internal      or external applications can access the FlipDB HTTP API, sending      and receiving JSON or XML.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
