FlipDB Desktop has its own session, and      does not use APL characters.</p>      <p>Aside from this section, written expressly for the APL programmer,      all of the examples in the user guide and reference manual are shown      in the FlipDB Session. These translate directly for the APL programmer      by simply replacing = with ←, and double quotes with single quotes.      In addition, the FlipDB Session displays results verbosely. The APL      programmer can access this by running the Display method on any object.</p>      <h2>Installation</h2>      <p>FlipDB is is distributed in a folder named FlipDB, containing      a workspace named FlipDB.dws, and other various support files. Uncompress      and place the folder anywhere. Load the workspace, and you are ready      to begin.</p>      <h2>Getting Started</h2>      <p>To do anything in FlipDB, you need to create a server. A server      may be thought of as a project, and indeed the terms are interchangable.      (FlipDB Desktop uses the term project, as this indicates that the      server is opened exclusively for direct access rather than via HTTP      over the internet.)</p>      <p>A server is represented by a folder on disk. To create a new server,      use the CreateServer function, located in the #.FlipDB.Admin namespace:</p>      <pre>        <code>      s←CreateServer 'c:FlipDBMyProject'</code>      </pre>      <p>When creating a server, the folder must not already exist, but      the parent folder must exist. To open an existing server, use the      OpenServer function:</p>      <pre>        <code>      s←OpenServer 'c:FlipDBMyProject'</code>      </pre>      <p>Both of these functions return a server object. With the server      object in hand, you are ready to create databases, import data, and      run queries.</p>      <h2>Creating a Database</h2>      <p>Create a new database using the Server's createDatabase method:</p>      <pre>        <code>      d←s.CreateDatabase 'MyDB'</code>      </pre>      <p>FlipDB has two sample databases built in. You can create the famous      suppliers and parts database of C.J. Date using:</p>      <pre>        <code>      d←s.BuildSuppliersAndParts 'SandP'</code>      </pre>      <p>Or you can create the less well known sample mortgage loan database:</p>      <pre>        <code>      d←s.BuildLoanSample 'SampleLoan'</code>      </pre>      <p>To access an existing database, use the server's GetDatabase method:</p>      <pre>        <code>      d←s.GetDatabase 'SandP'</code>      </pre>      <p>or the Get method, which accesses an item on the server via its      URL:</p>      <pre>        <code>      d←s.Get '/Databases/SandP'</code>      </pre>      <h2>Importing a CSV File</h2>      <p>To import a CSV file, create an import object, set a few properties,      and run the Execute method:</p>      <pre>        <code>      i←s.NewImport ''      i.SourceName←'C:ile.txt'      i.SourceType←'CSV'      i.TargetDatabaseName←'MyDB'      i.TargetTableName←'MyTable'      t←i.Execute 0The result of Execute is a table object.</code>      </pre>      <h2>Executing a Query</h2>      <p>To execute a query, create a query object, set a few properties,      and run the Execute method:</p>      <pre>        <code>      q←s.NewQuery ''      q.DatabaseName←'MyDB'      q.TableName←'MyTable'      q.Where←'Rate &gt; 10'      dt←q.Execute 0</code>      </pre>      <p>The result of the Execute method is a datatable object.</p>      <h2>Saving Objects on the Server</h2>      <p>By definintion, databases and tables are stored in the server.      Other flipdb object types, like Import, Query, and DataTable, may      be stored as well using server's Put method:'</p>      <pre>        <code>      s.Put '/Objects/MyFirstQuery' q      s.Put '/Objects/MyFirstImport' i      s.Put '/Objects/SomeData' dt</code>      </pre>      <p>These may be retrieved using the Get method:</p>      <pre>        <code>      q←s.Get '/Objects/MyFirstQuery'      i←s.Get '/Objects/MyFirstImport'      dt←s.Get '/Objects/SomeData'</code>      </pre>      <p>Any item may be deleted using the Delete method:</p>      <pre>        <code>      s.Delete '/Objects/SomeData'</code>      </pre>    </main>  </body></html>
