Functions may be symbolic or a more verbose        word, or both. For example, the basic arithmetic functions are        <a href="/Functions/plus">plus</a>        (+),        <a href="/Functions/minus">minus</a>        (*) and        <a href="/Functions/divide">divide</a>        (/). Either the word or symbol may be used when writing expressions.        Functions are strictly grouped into four types: scalar, aggregate,        hybrid, and structural, described in detail below. In addition,        functions are loosely grouped into categories for convenience in        locating them. Categories include arithmetic, date and time, text,        and financial.      </p>      <p>There are also functions that take tables as arguments and return      a table as a result. These are discussed separately in the chapter      on DataTables.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
