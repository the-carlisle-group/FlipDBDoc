Often this is just a subtitle and some simple        text, but it can be much more.      </p>      <p>Text objects are specified in Markdown, a simple way to write      nicely formatted text. FlipDB supports all major Markdown features,      including tables.</p>      <p>In addition the Text object supports FlipDB expressions, so values      may be computed dynamically.
