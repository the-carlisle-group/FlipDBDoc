They usually      have an "xls" or "xlsx" extension. FlipDB assumes that the entire      used range of the active sheet is to be imported. This range may      or may not have column names in the first row. The HasHeader property      indicates whether or not the first row contains field names.</p>      <p>FlipDB makes no assumptions about the data type of an Excel column,      and imports all columns as Char columns. Columns must be explicitly      converted to the appropriate FlipDB data type by applying a casting      function like toInteger or toDate.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
