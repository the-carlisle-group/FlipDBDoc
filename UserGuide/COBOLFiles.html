The initial import process is the same as for ASCII Fixed      Width files, requires a column name, a starting byte position and      a width in bytes. If you are lucky, you have been provided a layout      that includes the starting position and possibly the width of each      field in the file, If not, you must compute it by inspecting the      COBOL copybook and keeping a running total of the byte widths of      each field as you move through the layout. It is best to use a spreadsheet      to do this.</p>      <p>All fields are initially imported as Char columns. However, they      will be inscrutable because they are not in ASCII or Unicode. FlipDB      supports 7 COBOL field types and has 7 associated functions to convert      them to the appropriate FlipDB type. These are summarized in the      following table:</p>      <table>        <thead>          <tr>            <th class="center">COBOL Type</th>            <th class="center">Notes</th>          </tr>        </thead>        <tbody>          <tr>            <td class="center">Char</td>            <td class="center">An EBCDIC character field. May be any number            of bytes. Copybook picture looks like XX for 2 bytes X(9) for            9 bytes.

Looks            like a Char column of digits 0 to 9, except the last byte is            packed with a digit and a sign, and thus appears as a funny            looking character. May be any number of bytes. Requires function            compSigned to convert to FlipDB Integer or Decimal type.</td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>      <p>The â†’[*.cobolChar] function is used for character fields, and      simply converts EBCDIC to ASCII. For example: It is often the case      that a COBOL file will use a character field to store numerical data.      These will need additional functions applied for example:</p>      <p>The cobolComp3 function is applied to COMP-3 fields, also known      as Packed or Packed Decimal fields. In this field type, two digits      are packed into a single byte, with the lowest byte containing a      digit and a sign (negative or positive). These fields will often      have an implied decimal which may be provided as the left argument      to cobolComp3.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
