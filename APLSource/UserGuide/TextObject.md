# The Text Object

The →[*.TextBefore] and →[*.TextAfter] properties
provide arbitrary and general content before and after a query. Often this
is just a subtitle and some simple text, but it can be much more.

Text objects are specified in Markdown, a simple way to write nicely formatted
text. FlipDB supports all major Markdown features, including tables.

In addition the Text object supports FlipDB expressions, so values may
be computed dynamically. These expressions are evaluated in the context
of the associated query.
