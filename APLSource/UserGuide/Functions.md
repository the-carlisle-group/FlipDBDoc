# Functions

Functions operate on →[*.DataColumn|DataColumns] and return DataColumns. Functions may be
symbolic or a more verbose word, or both. For example, the basic arithmetic functions are
→[*.plus] (+) →[*.minus] (-) →[*.times] (**) and →[*.divide] (/). Either the word or
symbol may be used when writing expressions. Functions are strictly grouped into four types:
scalar, aggregate, hybrid, and structural, described in detail below. In addition, functions are
loosely grouped into categories for convenience in locating them. Categories include  arithmetic,
date and time, text, and financial.

There are also functions that take tables as arguments and return a table as a result. These are
discussed separately in the chapter on DataTables.
