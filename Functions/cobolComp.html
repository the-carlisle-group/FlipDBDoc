X represents      the implied number of decimal places in Y. X is optional and may      be a 0 (the default) or an Integer from 1 to 9. If X is omitted or      0, R is Y converted to Integer. If X is greater than 0, then R is      converted to Dec(X).</p>      <p>E is the expected encoding of Y and may be EBCDIC (the default)      or ASCII. In most cases the encoding will be EBCDIC, and it is only      necessary to specify ASCII if the file has previously been converted      to ASCII. If E is provided, X must be provided as well.</p>      <p>This function is normally only used when importing COBOL files.      In COBOL terminology, COMP is short for COMPUTATIONAL, and is also      sometimes referred to as BINARY.</p>      <h2>Examples</h2>      <pre>        <code>      hexToChar 'FFFF2BAC'┌───────┐│ÿÿ+¬   │└Char(4)┘      cobolComp hexToChar 'FFFF2BAC'┌────────┐│(54,356)│└Int32───┘      a=cobolChar hexToChar 'FFFF2BAC'      a┌───────┐│ÿÿÔ    │└Char(4)┘      4 'ASCII' cobolComp a┌────────┐│(5.4356)│└Dec(4)──┘</code>      </pre>    </main>  </body></html>
