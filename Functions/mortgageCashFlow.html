R is a property space containing detailed and aggregated cash      flows, prices and yields specified below.</p>      <p>This is a complex function with many inputs. Please see the →[*.MortgageCashFlows|Mortgage      Cash Flows] section of the user guide for a discusssion and examples.</p>      <h2>Inputs</h2>      <p>The right argument X is a property space that may contain zero      or more of the following named inputs. Every input has a default      value, and any input may be elided. Each input may be scalar or simple      (a list) for pricing one or more mortgages. Scalar extension applies,      so providing say 1 balance but 500 rates will return 500 cash flows,      yields, prices, etc.</p>      <p>This function may be used in ungrouped or grouped queries, providing      loan level or repline pricing respectively. If used in a grouped      query, then inputs must be aggregrated.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>ID</strong>      </p>      <p>A loan number, rep line description, or other identifier. Must      be character. The default is '00000001', '00000002', '000000003',      etc.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>StatedPrice</strong>      </p>      <p>The price used to compute the ComputedYield output. The default      is 0.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>StatedYield</strong>      </p>      <p>The yield used to compute the ComputedPrice output. The default      is 0.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>Balance</strong>      </p>      <p>The balance of the loan. This may be the original balance on a      new loan, or the current balance on a seasoned loan. Numeric. Default      value is 100,000. It is always the total balance of the loan, including      any nonperfoming component.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>NonperformingBalance</strong>      </p>      <p>The nonperforming balance of the loan. Defaults to 0. Balance      less NonperformingBalance determines the performing balance.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>Rate</strong>      </p>      <p>The rate for the life of the loan for a fixed rate loan, or the      rate for the first rate adjustment period for an adjustable loan.      Numeric. If adjustable, and the Rate is 0, then rate for the first      rate adjustment period (as all subsequent periods) is determined      by Index, Margin, etc. The default value is 6.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>Term</strong>      </p>      <p>The term of the loan. This may be the original term on a new loan      or the remaining term on a seasoned loan. Integer. Defaults to 360.      Must be integer greater than 0.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>Payment</strong>      </p>      <p>The monthly principal and interest payment. If non-zero this is      used to amortize the loan. If zero, the payment is calculated by      fully amortizing the loan according to the AmortizationTerm, Balance,      and Rate. For a fixed rate loan Payment and Amorization are mutually      exclusive - only one is used to generate the cashflow, and payment      takes precedence. For adjustable rate loans, if non-zero, this is      the first or current payment. The AmortizationTerm will be used to      determine subsequent payments at payment change periods.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>AmortizationTerm</strong>      </p>      <p>The term used to amortize the loan when the Payment is 0. Integer,      defaults to 360. If Payment and AmortizationTerm are both 0, then      the loan is considered interest only.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>IOPeriod</strong>      </p>      <p>The interest only period on the loan. This may be the original      IO period on a new loan, or the remaining IO period on a seasoned      loan. Integer. The default value is 0.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>InactivityPeriod</strong>      </p>      <p>The inactivity period shifts the cashflows out by the specified      number of months. This may be useful for loans in forbearance or      loans being modified. The inactivity period is applied at very end      of the cashflow generation process. Once the cashflows have been      generated according to all of the other parameters, all the flows      are shifted out by padding with zeros with the exeption of BeginningPerformingBalance,      BeginningNonperformingBalance, PerformingBalance' NonperformingBalance,      Balance, and DelinquentBalance, which are shifted out by replicating      the first element of each flow. The default value is 0.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>ServiceFee</strong>      </p>      <p>The service fee on the loan. Numeric. Provided as a percentage,      for example 0.25. The default is 0.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>PenaltyFee</strong>      </p>      <p>Prepayment penalty fee. A percentage, for example 2.5. Default      is 0.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>PenaltyPeriod</strong>      </p>      <p>Prepayment penalty period. The number of month for which the prepayment      penalty rate it in effect.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>StepLoan</strong>      </p>      <p>This is a boolean flag indicating that the loan is a step-rate      loan. The default is 0. If set to 1, then StepPeriods and StepIncrements      are used to determine the interest rates over time.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>StepPeriods</strong>      </p>      <p>Periods corresponding to StepIncrements. For example, 6 12 24      means the rate will step up in month 6, then in month 12, and then      in month 24 for the last time.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>StepIncrements</strong>      </p>      <p>Rate increments corresponding to StepPeriods. For example .25      .25 .5 means that the rate will increase by .25, then by .25 again,      then finally by .5.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>Adjustable</strong>      </p>      <p>This is a Boolean flag, 1 for Adjustable, 0 for fixed rate. The      default is 0.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>Margin</strong>      </p>      <p>This is the margin. Default is 0. Only applicable if Adjustable      is 1.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>InitialRateAdjustmentPeriod</strong>      </p>      <p>Defaults to the specified RateAdjustmentPeriod. Only applicable      if Adjustable is 1.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>RateAdjustmentPeriod</strong>      </p>      <p>The number of months between rate adjustments. 1 means the rate      adjusts every month, 12 means once a year. Defaults to 0. Only applicable      if Adjustable is 1.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>MaximumRateAdjustment</strong>      </p>      <p>The periodic cap, or the maximum the rate can go up in one adjustment      period. Only applicable if Adjustable is 1.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>MaximumRate</strong>      </p>      <p>The life time cap. The highest the rate is allowed to be. 0 means      no cap. The default is 0. Only applicable if Adjustable is 1.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>MinimumRate</strong>      </p>      <p>The floor. The lowest the rate is allowed to be. Defaults to 0.      Only applicable if Adjustable is 1.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>InitialPaymentAdjustmentPeriod</strong>      </p>      <p>Defaults to the PaymentAdjustmentPeriod Only applicable if Adjustable      is 1.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>PaymentAdjustmentPeriod</strong>      </p>      <p>The number of months between payment adjustments. The default      is 0. Only applicable if Adjustable is 1.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>MaximumPaymentAdjustment</strong>      </p>      <p>This maximum amount the payment can increase in one payment change      period. Only applicable if Adjustable is 1.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>MaximumPayment</strong>        Only applicable if Adjustable is 1.      </p>      <p>The absolute maximum amount of the payment.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>RecoveryPeriod</strong>      </p>      <p>The number of months it takes to recover the balance on a defaulting      loan. Integer. The default is 0.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>PrepaymentRateScenario</strong>      </p>      <p>This specifies the annual prepayment rate on a month by month      basis. Prepayment rates should be in the range 0 (the default) to      100, and are automatically capped or floored as appropriate. (No      error is given; A negative value is forced to 0, and any value over      100 is forced to 100.) A prepayment rate of 100 prepays the loan      entirely in the specific period. Thus, to fully prepay a loan in      the first month, simply set to the scalar value 100. To prepay fully      in six months, set to the vector 0 0 0 0 0 100. If the DefaultRateScenario      is 100 for a specific period, then the PrepaymentmentRateScenario      is forced to 0 for that specific period, regardless of what is specified.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>DefaultRateScenario</strong>      </p>      <p>This specifies the annual default rate on a month by month basis.      Like the PrepaymentRateScenario, values must be in the range 0 to      100, and are capped and floored similarly. Also similarly, a default      rate of 100 fully defaults the loan in the relevent period. If the      PrepaymentRateScenario is 100 for a specific period, then the DefaultRateScenario      is forced to 0 for that specific period, regardless of what is specified.      If BOTH the DefaultRateScenario and the PrepaymentRateScenario are      100, then the default rate takes precedence and the prepayment rate      is set to 0.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>ResecuritizationRateScenario</strong>      </p>      <p>This specifies the annual resecuritization rate on a month by      month basis. The resecuritization rate determines the portion of      the performing balance that is resold into a security at par value.      This is useful for modelling loans that have been bought out of a      security with the intent of curing and redelivering, or loans that      have yet to be sold inot a security.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>LossSeverityScenario</strong>      </p>      <p>This specifies the loss severity on a month by month basis.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>DelinquencyRateScenario30</strong>      </p>      <p>This specifies the 30-day delinquency rate on a month by month      basis.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>DelinquencyRecoveryRate30</strong>      </p>      <p>This specifies the 30-day delinquency recovery rate. It defaults      to 0. In this case, none of the delinquent interest is recovered,      and all of the delinquent principal is defaulted. A value of 100      indicates that all of the interest in principal is recovered in the      next period.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>DelinquencyAdvanceRate30</strong>      </p>      <p>This specifies the 30-day delinquency advance rate. It defaults      to 0, indicating that no principal or interest is advanced by the      servicer. A non-zero delinquency advance rate imples a lower "net      delinquency" rate. For example, a 20% delinquency rate with a 75%      advance rate implies a 5% net rate delinquency rate.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>IndexScenario</strong>      </p>      <p>This specifies the index for an ARM on a month by month basis.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>OutputNames</strong>      </p>      <p>A list of cashflow detail output names to be kept in the result.      This defaults to all the names. There are many outputs, and with      large data sets it can be useful to restrict the output only to the      values needed for further computation. If output is restricted via      this input property, then the Excel detail cashflow report is not      available.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>Title</strong>      </p>      <p>A title for reporting. It is useful for this to be a constant      to identify the pricing scenario or company name, but it may vary      by loan or group (repline).</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>Subtitle</strong>      </p>      <p>A subtitle for reporting. Useful to vary by loan or group (repline)      to identify the particular loan or group, but may also be a constant.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>LoanDynamicsOutput</strong>      </p>      <p>This input may be assigned the result of →[loanDynamicsModel]      and is used for reporting purposes only. It does not affect the model      in any way. Specific LDM outputs must be explicitly assigned to specific      mortgageCashFlow inputs. If this input is specified, the outputs      (and inputs) of LDM are included on the Excel detail spreadsheet.</p>      <h2>Time-Series Inputs Time-series inputs may vary as follows:</h2>      <p>Input Structure | One Loan | Multiple Loans --------------- |      -------- | ------------------------------ Scalar | Constant | One      constant rate for all loans Simple | n/a | A different constant rate      for each loan Enclosed | Time-Varying | One time-varying rate vector      for all loans Partitioned | n/a | A different time-varying rate vector      for each loan</p>      <h2>Outputs The result of mortgageCashFlow is a property space containing:</h2>      <p>        1.        <strong>Status</strong>      </p>      <p>A text column containing a status code. Status is ‘OK’ for successful      cash flow generation and price and yield calculuations. If cash flow      is successfully generated, but there is an error computing the price      or yield, then Status is either 'Error computing price' or 'Error      computing yield'. Otherwise Status is an error message specifying      where in the cash flow generation process the error occurred. The      AggregateCashFlow output will only include loans that have status      equal to 'OK', 'Error computing price', or 'Error computing yield'.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>ComputedPrice</strong>      </p>      <p>The computed price given the StatedYield input. This price is      computed on CashFlow.CashFlow (see CashFlow property space below).      Additional prices may be computed using the →[mortgageCashFlowPrice]      function.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>ComputedYield</strong>      </p>      <p>The computed yield given the StatedPrice input. This yield is      computed on CashFlow.CashFlow (see CashFlow property space below).      Additional yields may be computed using the →[mortgageCashFlowYield]      function.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>CashFlow</strong>      </p>      <p>A property space containing monthly cash flow detail for each      loan.</p>      <p>        1.        <strong>AggregatedCashFlow</strong>      </p>      <p>A DataTable containing aggregated cash flows. Columns are summed      or weighted-averaged by BeginningBalance as appropriate.</p>      <p>Some outputs are non time-varying per mortgage (e.g. price and      yield). Most output columns are time-varying per mortgage (e.g. ScheduledPrincipal      and StartingBalance), and are contained in the CashFlow property      space. If a single loan is priced, the time-varying outputs are simple      (a list) and the non time-varying columns are scalar. If multiple      loans are priced, the time-varying output columns are partitioned      (list of lists) and the non time-varying outputs are simple.</p>      <h2>The CashFlow Property Space Output</h2>      <p>The outputs are listed below in order of their computation, as      an aid to undertanding the model.
