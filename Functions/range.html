(Float values      must be explicitly converted to Decimal using →[toDecimal] or →[round]      before ranging.) X determines how Y is to be ranged. Acceptable values      for X depend on the type of Y. The result R is the same type as Y.      Values in Y are converted to the lower bound of the bucket in which      they would appear.</p>      <p>Note that while the result of the range function is the same type      as the argument, FlipDB maintains internally the complete range specification      so that reports may be appropriately formatted.</p>      <h2>Ranging Numeric Columns.</h2>      <p>For columns of type Integer or Decimal, a range specification      X is an increasing series of break points. For example:</p>      <pre>        <code>20 30 40 50</code>      </pre>      <p>If the range specification is a triple, with the last item less      than the middle item, then the argument is interpreted as a “from-to-by”      triple, rather than an explicit set of break points. For example:</p>      <pre>        <code>20 80 10</code>      </pre>      <p>is equivalent to:</p>      <pre>        <code>20 30 40 50 60 70 80</code>      </pre>      <p>(Note that each element in a from-to-by triple must be non-negative      in order to be interpreted as such.)</p>      <p>If the range specification is a scalar, it is interpreted as a      bucket size, with the number of buckets determined by the minimum      and the maximum of the data. For example, a range of 10 on data with      a minimum value of 22 and a maximum value of 55 is equivalent to:</p>      <pre>        <code>20 30 40 50 60</code>      </pre>      <p>The break points represent the lower, inclusive bound of the range.      The upper bound is implied by the following break point (thus N break      points imply N-1 buckets). For example, for an integer column, the      break points 20,30,40,50 define the ranges 20 to 29, 30 to 39, and      40 to 49, while the break points 1,21,31, 41 define the ranges 1      to 20, 21 to 30, and 31 to 40. For a decimal column of precision      3, the break points 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5 defines the range buckets 5.000      to 5.499, 5.500 to 5.999, and 6.000 to 6.499, while the break points      5.001, 5.501, 6.001, 6.501 defines the range buckets 5.001 to 5.500,      5.501 to 6.000, 6.001 to 6.500.</p>      <p>A range definition cannot exclude data. If a range is specified      such that it does not include all of the data, then a top or bottom      bucket (or both) will be added automatically. These additional buckets      will be exactly sized to fit the extra data, indicating the minimum      and maximum values in the column.</p>      <h2>Ranging Date Columns</h2>      <p>Ranging date columns works in a similar manner to numeric columns.      Break points may be specified as an ascending series of dates, and      a from-to-by triple may be specified as two dates and an integer.      If the integer is positive, it is interpreted as a number of days.      If the integer is negative, it is interpreted as a number of months.      As with the numeric columns, the "from" and "to" may be elided, and      only an integer provided, indicating the bucket size in days or months.</p>    </main>  </body></html>
