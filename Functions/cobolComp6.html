X represents      the implied number of decimal places in Y. X is optional and may      be a 0, the default, or an Integer from 1 to 9. If X is omitted or      0, R is Y converted to Integer. If X is greater than 0, then R is      converted to Dec(X).</p>      <p>E is the expected encoding of Y and may be EBCDIC (the default)      or ASCII. In most cases the encoding will be EBCDIC, and it is only      necessary to specify ASCII if the file has previously been converted      to ASCII. If E is provided, X must be provided as well.</p>      <p>This function is normally only used when importing COBOL files.      In COBOL terminology, COMP-6 is short for COMPUTATIONAL-6, and is      also sometimes referred to as an unsigned packed or unsigned packed      decimal field. It is similar to COMP-3, except that while COMP-3      is signed, COMP-6 is unsigned. COMP-3 is a much more commonly occurring      field type than COMP-6.</p>      <pre>        <code>      hexToChar  '271828'┌───────┐│'(     │└Char(3)┘      cobolComp6 hexToChar  '271828'┌───────┐│271,828│└Int32──┘      5 cobolComp6 hexToChar  '271828'┌───────┐│2.71828│└Dec(5)─┘      a=cobolChar hexToChar  '271828'      5 'ASCII' cobolComp6 a┌───────┐│2.71828│└Dec(5)─┘</code>      </pre>    </main>  </body></html>
