R is Integer representing the number of days difference      between Y and a specific date origin. R is commonly referred to as      a serial number. X is an optional Boolean scalar and specifies the      date origin. X should be omitted or 0 when converting dates to serial      numbers that need to be compatible with Microsoft Excel.</p>      <p>If X is 0 or omitted, the date origin is December 30th 1899. This      is compatible with Microsoft Excel for serial numbers 61 and greater,      which corresponds to dates on or after March 1st 1900. There is a      one day discrepancy for dates in January and February of 1900 which      correspond to serial numbers less than 61, due to long-standing behavior      in Excel. If Y is a null date, R is zero. While Excel itself does      not handle dates earlier than January 1st 1900, Y may in fact be      earlier than December 30th 1899, which will yield negative serial      numbers.</p>      <p>If X is 1, the date origin is one day before the start of the      Common Era on the false assumption that the Gregorian Calendar has      been in effect for the entire period.</p>      <p>Dates prior to the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in the country      under consideration will give incorrect results.</p>      <p>See also: →[fromSerial]</p>      <h2>Examples</h2>      <pre>        <code>       toSerial '1999-12-31,2000-01-01'┌──────┐↓36,525││36,526│└Int32─┘       toSerial '1899-12-29,1899-12-30,1899-12-31'┌────┐↓(1) ││0   ││1   │└Int8┘       toSerial '0000-00-00'┌────┐│0   │└Int8┘       1 toSerial '1999-12-31,2000-01-01'┌───────┐↓730,119││730,120│└Int32──┘       1 toSerial '1899-12-29,1899-12-30,1899-12-31'┌───────┐↓693,593││693,594││693,595│└Int32──┘</code>      </pre>    </main>  </body></html>
