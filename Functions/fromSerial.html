R is Date and is the date      that corresponds to Y. X is an optional Boolean scalar and specifies      the date origin. X should be 0 or omitted when converting serial      numbers generated in Microsoft Excel.</p>      <p>If X is 0 or omitted, the date origin is December 30th 1899. This      is compatible with Microsoft Excel for serial numbers 61 and greater,      which corresponds to dates on or after March 1st 1900. There is a      one day discrepancy for dates in January and February of 1900 which      corresponds to serial numbers less than 61, due to a long-standing      bug in Excel. If Y is zero, R is a null date. While Excel itself      does not handle dates earlier than January 1st 1900, Y may in fact      be negative, and R will then be a date earlier than the date origin      of December 30th 1899.</p>      <p>If X is 1, then the date origin is one day before the start of      the Common Era on the false assumption that the Gregorian Calendar      has been in effect for the entire period.</p>      <p>This function can be used to retrieve the actual date values of      the results of a calculation on integers previously converted from      dates with the toSerial function. In this case, care should be taken      to ensure the same date origin, or value for X, is used in both conversions.      In addition, it should be noted that fromSerial and toSerial are      NOT inverses of each other when the date in question is the date      origin itself. Therefore, computations that involve December 30th,      1899 should always use 1 as a value for X.</p>      <p>See also: →[toSerial]</p>      <h2>Examples</h2>      <pre>        <code>      fromSerial  -1 0 1 2 60 61 36525 36526┌──────────┐↓1899-12-29││          ││1899-12-31││1900-01-01││1900-02-28││1900-03-01││1999-12-31││2000-01-01│└Date──────┘      1 fromSerial 0 1 2 730119 730120┌──────────┐↓          ││   1-01-01││   1-01-02││1999-12-31││2000-01-01│└Date──────┘</code>      </pre>    </main>  </body></html>
